# Todo Lists and Internal Discussions

### Intro

Every `.todo` file will be represented as the version maintainance, once a new created `issue` will be posted and approved for new feature or removal, it will be listed in the said version.

### Can I do a Pull Request?

Yes, as long as there is a thread created and some upvotes and approvals to all contributors, as well a Proof of Concept.

### What you can do?

Post an new `issue` and share a `new feature` or anything regarding Solid Layer, or even `ask a question`.

### What I can't do?

Posting `Bug Fixes`, will be tagged as `Unrelated Post`, and will be automatically marked as `Closed` issue, all these must be under the `/framework` repository.
